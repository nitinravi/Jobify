# Jobify

This is my first React Native Application built by following a [YT guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ3bGvy0WAY&list=LL&index=1&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery). I've integrated JSearch API for the Job details (available on RapidAPI). Adding your own API Key to the [id].js file in the search folder and useFetch.js file in the job details folder should make the application ready to compile and run!

## Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## üöÄ How to use

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-router
```
